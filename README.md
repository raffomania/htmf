# hypertext markup functions

> [!WARNING]
This is alpha-quality, completely insecure software.

Functions for generating HTML from Rust in a declarative fashion:

```rust
a(
    [href("https://www.rafa.ee"), class("link")],
    [text("My Site")],
)
.to_html();
```

## Advantages

- Fast compile times
- Leverage Rust tooling for formatting, linting, syntax highlighting, ...
- Strong compile-time guarantees
- Easier to debug than custom template languages or macros
- Function calls are visually similar to HTML's structure, making it familiar

## Drawbacks

- It's not clear how to configure tailwind's editor integration to work in .rs files
- Rust's default indentation of 4 spaces is a bit wide for heavily nested html
- Can't copy and paste HTML from other sources
- Long lines, e.g. with many tailwind classes, can cause [rustfmt to give up formatting that line](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt/issues/3863). Using [the nightly format_strings option](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustfmt/?version=v1.6.0&search=#format_strings) can work around some cases. Lowering [the tab_spaces option](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustfmt/?version=v1.6.0&search=#tab_spaces) can help, too

## Prior Art

- [Elm's html package](https://github.com/elm/html)
- Gleam's [nakai](https://github.com/nakaixo/nakai) and [lustre](https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre)
- 🦀 [html-rs](https://github.com/ancos2505/html-rs) has a more verbose API than this crate, and uses the builder pattern
- 🦀 [html-builder](https://github.com/asayers/html-builder) uses the `writeln!` macro to build HTML in a string buffer
- 🦀 [build_html](https://github.com/skubalj/build_html) has a slightly more verbose API than this crate, and uses the builder pattern
- [leptos' view builder](https://book.leptos.dev/view/builder.html#no-macros-the-view-builder-syntax) has heavily inspired the API of this crate, but has a much wider scope than just rendering HTML

## Development Setup

For benchmarks, install `cargo-criterion`, e.g. using `cargo install cargo criterion`.

For working on the examples, install a nightly rust toolchain to use the unstable `format_strings` rustfmt option.
